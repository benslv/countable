## Get started

### Self-hosted

I'd recommend hosting an instance of this bot yourself, because the server I've got mine running on isn't really designed for a huge number of guilds.

First off, you need to create a bot user to run this client from. [**Here's a good guide**](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) on how to do this!

From here on out, these instructions will assume you've got a server set up or are planning on running the bot from your current computer.

1. **Clone the repo**

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/silverben10/countable.git
```

2. **`cd` into the newly created directory**

```zsh
cd countable
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```zsh
npm install
```

or

```zsh
yarn install
```

4. **Create a `config.json` file** in the root of the project directory. Place the _Client ID_ and _Client Token_ from the bot application into it like so:

```json
{
  "CLIENT_ID": "ID goes here",
  "CLIENT_TOKEN": "token goes here"
}
```

5. (Optional) You should be able to quickly test that everything's been set up correctly so far by typing the following:

```zsh
node index.js
```

> Come to think of it, that probably won't work because you haven't added the bot to any servers yet. Follow [**this guide**](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html) on how to get that done!

6. **Get the bot running permanently**
   Cool, nearly there! The last thing you'll probably want to do is get the bot running using some kind of process manager so it's not sitting there in a terminal window taking up precious screen real estate. I'd recommend using PM2 (literally only because that's what _I_ first found and decided to use).
   Courtesy of discordjs.guide _again_, [**here's a good set of instructions**](https://discordjs.guide/improving-dev-environment/pm2.html#installation) on how to set _that_ up!

### Grab an invite link from me

If you _really_ don't want to or can't self-host this bot yourself, it's worth giving me a ping on Discord and seeing if you can invite my instance to your server.

## How to use

The one _essential_ thing you need to do before this bot will work is setup a channel to be used as the counting channel.

Once you've created it, use the following command to set it up:

```
`set-channel <channel ID>
```

This will set the bot watching the channel of your choice, so have fun counting!
