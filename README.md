ðŸ¤– Countable is a small, robust Discord bot to support and manage a counting channel in your server!

[![DeepScan grade](https://deepscan.io/api/teams/11357/projects/14263/branches/260846/badge/grade.svg)](https://deepscan.io/dashboard#view=project&tid=11357&pid=14263&bid=260846) [![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/benslv/countable)](https://david-dm.org/benslv/countable) [![https://github.com/benslv/countable/issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/benslv/countable)](https://github.com/benslv/countable/issues)

## Getting Started

Setup is extremely easy, and only requires a couple of commands to get everything up and running!

1. [Invite](https://invite.countable.cc) the bot to your server.

2. Get Countable to watch your counting channel with [`set-channelâ€‹`](https://docs.countable.cc/commands#set-channel).

3. The count will start at 0, but you can use [`set-count`](https://docs.countable.cc/commands#set-count) if you want to continue from an existing counting channel.

Happy counting!

## [Documentation](https://docs.countable.cc)

Full documentation of the bot, including a list of [commands](https://docs.countable.cc/commands) and a guide on how to [self-host](https://docs.countable.cc/self-hosting) your own version Countable can be found [here](https://docs.countable.cc).

## Contributing
I don't yet have a guide on how to start contributing to Countable, but rest assured I absolutely *love* it when other people show interest in getting involved with the development; it brings me so much joy!

If you'd like to help fix any of Countable's bugs, implement a new feature, or do anything else you can think of that might be helpful, check out the [issues](https://github.com/benslv/countable/issues) pages to see if anything piques your interest.

I'm pretty active on GitHub so will be around to respond to any questions you have as quick as possible!
